# DSL Vote Listener
This is an old project of mine that I have decided to rewrite. 

The bot uses slash commands and can handle many server's webhooks.

## Features
- Discord slash commands
- A reporting webhook
- A leaderboard
- Voting messages
- Voting roles (coming soon)
- Counting votes per user (resets will be possible).

## Documentation
This bot is slightly overkill for one server.

Bot documentation can be found [here](DOCUMENTATION.md)

Dev documentation can be found [here](DEV_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Notes
Thanks for using DSL Vote Listener ❤️
