# DSL Vote Listener
This is an old project of mine that I have decided to rewrite. 

The bot uses slash commands and can handle many server's webhooks.

## Features
- Discord slash commands
- A reporting webhook that allows the bot to report errors to a channel in another server
- A leaderboard
- Voting messages
- Voting roles
- Counting votes per user
- Voting channels

## Documentation
This bot is slightly overkill for one server as it is designed to handle many, but it will work if you wish.

Bot documentation can be found [here](DOCUMENTATION.md)

Dev documentation can be found [here](DEV_DOCUMENTATION.md)

This bot also runs an API, which can be found [here](API.md)

You need to have the auth token for the server you want to use the API on.

## Notes
Thanks for using DSL Vote Listener ❤️
